Description: Provides a comprehensive set of tools to simulate, evaluate,
    and compare model-assisted designs for early-phase (Phase I/II)
    clinical trials. Includes flexible simulation parameters that allow
    researchers to efficiently compute operating characteristics under
    various fixed and random trial scenarios and export the results.
