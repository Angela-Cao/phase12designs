Description: phase12designs provides a comprehensive set of tools to simulate, evaluate, and compare model-assisted designs for early-phase (Phase I/II) clinical trials, including BOIN12, BOINET, EffTox, Ji3+3, PRINTE, STEIN, TEPI, and uTPI. The package includes flexible simulation parameters that allow researchers to efficiently compute operating characteristics under various (fixed and random) trial scenarios and export the results for further analysis.
